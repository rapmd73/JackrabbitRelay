# This is the Jackrabbit limit order manager. Its purpose is to track and maintain "orphaned" orders. Orphan orders are liit
# order that the parent or order initiator does not wat a response for. TradingView is an example, but the situation applies
# to any process that does not manage or maintain limit orders on their own.

# IMPORTANT: Under no circumstances should THIS program manage an individual order. It is to be managed by a separate process,
# called an orphan manager. This is simply because there is no way on knowing how many exchanges/brokers might be used
# simultaneously. The memory of a single process managing a thousand orders would be absolutely thrashed. The orphan manager
# will follow the same conventions of the PlaceOrder program, ie:

#    Orphan.ccxt
#    Orphan.oanda
#    Conditional.ccxt
#    Conditional.oanda
#    Conditional.mimic

# ANY order (direct orphan or conditional) is an ORPHAN at all times withis THIS framework.

# IMPORTANT: This fraework treats conditionals the same as orphans. The separation and distinction takes place in the
# transactor. While this has plenty of issues to be aware of, it is the most effecient way of handling the situation since at
# this level (dispatcher), they are syntactically the same.

# Framework identification, along with any other order verification, is done in the PlaceOrder
