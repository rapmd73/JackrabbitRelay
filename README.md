# JackrabbitRelay

Jackrabbit Relay is an API endpoint for stock, forex and cryptocurrency exchanges
that accept REST webhooks.

This software is designed to act as an intermediary between TradingView, or any
other REST payload generator, and a broker/exchange for stocks, forex, and
cryptocurrencies.
